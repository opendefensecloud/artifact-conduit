# Artifact Conduit (ARC)

![ARC LOGO](docs/arc_logo.png){height=200px}

Project ARC is an open-source system to bring a variety of artifact types into air-gapped environments.
It acts as a gateway to get artifacts from one zone to another while scans assure that only artifacts that match certain policies are transported.
These scans include malware, CVE, license scans including validation of signatures and the attestation of that process.
