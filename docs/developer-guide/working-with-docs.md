# Documentation Setup

The documentation of the ARC project is written primarily using Markdown.
All documentation related content can be found in <https://github.com/opendefensecloud/artifact-conduit/tree/main/docs>. New content also should be added there.

To render the documentation with `mkdocs` locally use `make docs` and open the local page:

```bash
$ make docs
mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  Documentation built in 0.22 seconds
INFO    -  [13:29:25] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
INFO    -  [13:29:25] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
